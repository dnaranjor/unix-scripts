# When you are running out of disk space, you need to concentrate on the biggest files and folders on your disk,
# so you can get space quickly.
# The best way, is to list the first 10 folders, then go inside some of them, and find files you may or can delete, 
# and get new free space.
#
# Commands needed
# There is not a single command in Linux to help us with this task, but we will use du, sort and head.
#
# du Summarize disk usage of each FILE, recursively for directories. 
# sort Write sorted concatenation of all FILE(s) to standard output. 
# head Print the first 10 lines of each FILE to standard output. 
# With more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file name. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.

# Find biggest top 10 folders in your disk

du -hs */ | sort -nr | head

# This will give you the biggest folders in the disk, then you can enter inside one of them, preferable the biggest ones.

# Find the biggest files inside folders

ls -lS | head

# That is, you now have the biggest files in that folder.

# Find biggest files in any folder recursively
# Weâ€™ll now use find, to find only files, and then sort, to have only the biggest files listed.

find -type f -ls | sort -k 7 -r -n | head -5

# find helps us list only files and not folders, then sort using the column 7 (the column with the file size) 
# we sort using -n numeric order and -r reverse order (from biggest to smallest), and finally only the 
# first 5 files in the current folder, and sub-folders.

# You can use this way

find / -type f -ls | sort -k 7 -r -n | head -5

# And that will work, for all disk from root.
