# Basically an inode is used for each file on the filesystem. So running out of inodes generally means you've got a lot
# of small files laying around. So the question really becomes, "what directory has a large number of files in it?"

#In this case, the filesystem we care about is the filesystem /var, so we can use the following command:

find /var -xdev -printf '%h\n' | sort | uniq -c | sort -k 1 -n

#This will dump a list of every directory on the filesystem prefixed with the number of files (and subdirectories)
# in that directory. Thus the directory with the largest number of files will be at the bottom.
