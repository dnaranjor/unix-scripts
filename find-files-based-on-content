#The find command is only able to filter the directory hierarchy based on a fileâ€™s name and meta data. If you need to search based on the content of the file, use a tool like grep. Consider the following example:

find . -type f -exec grep "example" '{}' \; -print

#This searches every object in the current directory hierarchy (.) that is a file (-type f) and then runs the command
#grep "example" for every file that satisfies the conditions. The files that match are printed on the screen 
# (-print). The curly braces ({}) are a placeholder for the find match results. The {} are enclosed in single 
#quotes (') to avoid handing grep a malformed file name. The -exec command is terminated with a semicolon (;), 
#which should be escaped (\;) to avoid interpretation by the shell.

#Before the implementation of the -exec option, this kind of command might have used the xargs command to generate a similar output:

find . -type f -print | xargs grep "example"
