# Clear contents of a file with truncate

truncate -s 0 file

# This is useful e.g for log clearing files. This is better than manually deleting a file and maybe doing a touch for the new one. 
The truncation process basically removes all the contents of the file. It does not remove the file itself, but it leaves it on
the disk as a zero byte file. As an example, let's clear our /var/log/syslog to 0 bytes using truncate.
